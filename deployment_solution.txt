To deploy the capstone, we will dockerize the code and then primarily use Azure cloud services. Here are the steps planned:
1. Create two docker images that can be pushed to the cloud.
2. Docker Image 1 is created from the scripts that will use the Reddit PushShift API to get the comments for Bitcoin and then predict the sentiment from those comments
and write to the CosmosDB data base.
3. Docker Image 2 is created from the scripts that will provide a web interface for the user to be able to provide the dates for which the sentiment analysis on bitcoin 
is needed. Taking those dates as the input, it will plot the sentiment for bitcoin.
4. Docker images are pushed to Azure Cloud by following the steps from: https://jonnychipz.com/2021/02/22/create-and-push-a-docker-image-to-azure-container-registry/
5. Docker Image 1 will be made to run every day automatically , so that the latest comments for bitcoin can be pulled into the data base. This is accomplihed by creating 
a task on Azure cloud and scheduling it to run in a periodic fashion(every day at 1AM). 
6.To create a publickly accessible web page, we will containerize the docker image 2 by following the steps below:

7. Finally, with the FQDN that is made available from the step 6 and with the data base updates from step 5, user should be able to get the dashboard for the Bitcoin sentiment
analysis through web.
